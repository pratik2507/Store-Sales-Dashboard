# Store-Sales-Dashboard
Hello Everyone,  I made this Store Sales Dashboard in Excel with sample Data of a Store that I collected from Kaggle.


 # Problem Statement
 - To design a Retail Store Sales Dashboard that provides a clear and concise overview of the Store's Sales performance enabling the owner to gain actionable insights.

# Section in the Problem

The report has Multiple Sections from where you can manage the Data, such as:

- Report Data can be sliced by Quarter of the Year to show Data for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4.

- Report Data can also be sliced by State to show sales of any particular State.

- It has cards showing the Total Amount, Total Profit, and Total Quantity of Sale.

- Report has a Bar Chart showing Total Profit by Month.

- I conditionally formatted the Bar Chart to show different color when there is loss in Business.

- Report has another Horizontal Bar Chart which shows Profit by Sub Category of Items.

- Then I have included a Donut Chart to show how much Quantity of Product is order through which Payment Mode.

- I also included a Donut Chart to show how much Quantity of Product is ordered in which Category.

- Then I included a Horizontal Bar Chart to show Top 4 Performing State in sales.

- And Lastly, I included a Bar Chart to show the Top 4 Customers of our Store.

- I have also included a Reset Button at the Top to clear all Slicers.

- To use it hold CTRL and then click it to reset the Slicer's.
